This is a simple todo app, built using React. I created this application to learn how React works. The backend is deployed on Heroku and database is hosted on MLab.com. Here is the list of all technologies used.

  - Node.js
  - Reactjs
  - MongoDB
  - Expressjs
  
 The application is hosted at http://young-mountain-34801.herokuapp.com/. Go check it out.

### Tech

This application uses a number of sources:

* [React] - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Redux] - JavaScript library for managing application state
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Reactstrap] - easy to use React Bootstrap 4 components
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Mongoose] -  MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment
* [React Transition Group] - perform animations when a React component enters or leaves the DOM
* [React Dev Tools] - Chrome DevTools extension for the open-source React JavaScript library
* [Redux Dev Tools] - Chrome DevTools for debugging application's state changes



### Installation

Follow these steps to run the application.

Clone the app. Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/farazmurtaza/react-todo.git
$ cd react-todo
$ npm install -d
$ npm run dev
```
This will install all dependencies and run the server on Port:5000 and client side on Port:3000. The application will open automatically on your default web browser.





Or you can verify by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
http://localhost:3000/
```
